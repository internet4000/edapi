# Proxy API for Discogs

This a node.js proxy api for Discogs. Itâ€¦

- send authenticated requests to Discogs
- caches everything with a Redis server

## How to use

1. Deploy this repo to any node host (remember to set keys in `.env` file)
2. Where you'd normally request `api.discogs.com`, change it to `edapi.glitch.com`

## How does it work?

- your app starts at `server.js`
- add frameworks and packages in `package.json`
- safely store app secrets in `.env` (nobody can see this but you and people you invite)
